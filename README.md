# Advent of Code 2025

Contains my solutions for solving each day of the challenge

## Running


To run the code just enter the following command:

```bash
cargo run n
```

with n being the day you want to run.


However some might still use the test data and not actual data.



Also one day is using a brute force solution, which took about 20 min to solve.
